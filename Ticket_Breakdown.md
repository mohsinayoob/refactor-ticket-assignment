# Ticket Breakdown
We are a staffing company whose primary purpose is to book Agents at Shifts posted by Facilities on our platform. We're working on a new feature which will generate reports for our client Facilities containing info on how many hours each Agent worked in a given quarter by summing up every Shift they worked. Currently, this is how the process works:

- Data is saved in the database in the Facilities, Agents, and Shifts tables
- A function `getShiftsByFacility` is called with the Facility's id, returning all Shifts worked that quarter, including some metadata about the Agent assigned to each
- A function `generateReport` is then called with the list of Shifts. It converts them into a PDF which can be submitted by the Facility for compliance.

## You've been asked to work on a ticket. It reads:

**Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they work with and use that id when generating reports for them.**


Based on the information given, break this ticket down into 2-5 individual tickets to perform. Provide as much detail for each ticket as you can, including acceptance criteria, time/effort estimates, and implementation details. Feel free to make informed guesses about any unknown details - you can't guess "wrong".


You will be graded on the level of detail in each ticket, the clarity of the execution plan within and between tickets, and the intelligibility of your language. You don't need to be a native English speaker, but please proof-read your work.

## Ticket 1
### Create a new table to store custom ID for agents provided by facility

Assumptions: An agent can work with multiple facilities in different times.
create a new table named `facilities-agents` to store custom facilities generated ID (let's call it customAgentId), and map those generated IDs to `facilities` and `agent` tables. That table would be treated as pivot table for many-many relationship between facilities and agents, thus this table would have the fields id, customAgentId, agentId, facilityId 

`customAgentId` will be mapped with auto generated `id` of `agent` table (`agent.id`)
`customAgentId` will be also mapped with `id` field of `facilities` table. (`facilities.id`) 

### Acceptence Criteria
- A new table `facilities-agents` created with proper defined relationships.
- Ability to run query by joining `agents`, `facilities`, `agent-facilities` tables
- Test with some dummy data to see if relation works.

### Implementation Details
- `facilities-agent` table contains `agents.id` from `agents` table as foreign key. 
- It contains `facilities.id` from `facilities` table as foreign key.
- It contains `customAgentId`, an unique UUID field as default when no user input were given.
- It contains default auto increament `id` field as primary key.


## Ticket 2
### Create/Update oparations on `facilities-agent` table

`facilities-agent` table is now storing `customAgentId` for agents generated by facilities. Add this function call with the assignment of agent to facility or provide interface to the facilities to create/update/get `customAgentId` for agents. This 

### Acceptence Criteria
- Ability to create new `customAgentId`
- Ability to update `customAgentId`
- Ability to get agent and facility data by exisiting `customAgentId`
- Should not be able to delete `customAgentId` once created
- Pass unit tests

### Implementation Details
- Write a function `assignCustomAgentId` to store `customAgentId` given by facility. When called, the function inserts/update `customAgentId` into table `facilities-agent` with related data. (`agents.id`, `facilities.id`)
- Write a function `getCustomAgentId` to delete a row by taking `customAgentId` as parameter



### Ticket 3
### Refactor `getShiftsByFacility` to attach `customAgentId` of agents

Refactor `getShiftsByFacility` function by adding a join query operation on `facilities-agent` to retrive `customAgentId` of agents.

### Acceptence Criteria
- Function populates `customAgentId` of agents of given facility (id).
- Pass unit tests


### Ticket 4
### Refactor `generateReport` to attach `customAgentId` of agents in the PDF report

Refactor `generateReport` function to `customAgentId` of agents in the PDF report

### Acceptence Criteria
- Function populates `customAgentId` of agents instead of internal db id in the PDF report
- `customAgentId` of agents should not be empty in the report
